        <p>
          I’m a French 18 years old student. I study at the Essec Bba in Cergy next to paris. 
          What can I say about me ?
          I’m a really sociable person, I love to meet new people and to be around my friends. 👭
          People often tell me I’m crazy, but they don’t know that I only enjoy my life !
          I’m a huge fan of tennis🎾, I play with a wilson raquet, and I’m a really competitive person, I hate to loose 😈. 
          My other Passion are travels. My biggest dream would be to travel all around the world. ✈️

        <h2>Travels 🚘✈️🌃</h2>
        <p> 
         I absolutely love to travel, especially to English speaking countrys. 
         What I like the most about travels is to discover new people and new cultures🔆.
         I have been to the USA, to Germany, Italie, Spain and England. My favorite trip so far was the city of lights; New York ⚡️🌇 !

        <h2>Sports 🎿🏆</h2>
        <p>
         I’m keen on sports, well, I’m mostly keen on tennis. 🎾
         I’ve played tennis for all my life and I started competition 8 years ago.🔥
         Tennis taught me so many things like my ability to focus and to be the best person I could be. 
         I also love skiing ⛷ but unfortunately I only ski once a year😕.
